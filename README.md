# Solar2D_ShaderBank

Shader viewer with real-time texture swapping and param tweaking features provided, plus collections of abounding Solar2D-ready shaders. 

full operation could be done purely by touching UI or keyboard input solely, no problem with using them both simultaneously of course.

NOTE: Almost of the shaders are working on simulator but havn't test on devices yet, currently I'm replacing some variables to vertexData in the shaders. if you encounter bugs on the shader viewer, just let me know :)


You might want to check the license of thier original creators if you gonna to use them in your projects. the information included in each shader.lua file.
